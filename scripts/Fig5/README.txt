Simulations of this figure have inherent randomness due to the randomized location of the stimulated cells and also the random distribution of Gkir in cells.Therefore, results might be slightly different from the ones published in the manuscript, but should follow the same trend. To increase reproducibility, reduce the standard deviation of Gkir values, and fix the location of stimulated cells.
