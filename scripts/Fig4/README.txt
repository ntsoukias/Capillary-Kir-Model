Simulations of this figure are stochastic due to the presence of TRPV4 channels. Also, Gkir values are taken from a normal distribution of random numbers. Therefore, results might be slightly different from the ones published in the manuscript, but should follow the same trend. For simulation in Fig. 4E, the time to return the system to the basal level following stimulus termination might be different depending on the generated TRPV4 traces. This return time can be shortend by reducing the time constants of Kir/TRPV4(bg) inactivation/activation. Also, regenerative conduction of the hyperpolarizing signal in Fig. 4E might not happen in every single trial. To ensure regenerative conduction, increase the Kir conductance. A pre-made dataset for TRPV4 traces are provided which result in a similar response for Fig. 4E in the manuscript.
