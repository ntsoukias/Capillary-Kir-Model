These scripts reproduce results shown in figure 7. The simulation for Figure 7A3 in the manuscript was performed using sensitization of nodes within a hypothetical barrel that is indicated by the red hyperpolarized region of 7A3. However, we also developed an alternative method involving sensitization of nodes from capillary generations extending linearly from the arterioles towards venules. This mode can be specified by setting "Options.SensitizeMode" at the top of "Fig7A3" code equal to either "barrel" or "generation". If using the "generation" mode, also specify the desired number of generations (ngen = 9 by default). "Options.SensitizeMode" is set to "barrel" by default.
