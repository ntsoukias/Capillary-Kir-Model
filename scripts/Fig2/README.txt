Simulations in Fig. 2G are stochastic due to the presence of TRPV4 channels. As a result, upon running the code, the result might be slightly different from the figure published in the manuscript, and in each run the resulting trace will vary. The solver used for the simulations of this figure is ode113. This solver performs best in capturing the transient TRPV4 depolarizations in a single cell. The code for Fig.2G may take a long time to run due to the time discretization for TRPV4 currents.
